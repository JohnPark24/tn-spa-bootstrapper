Getting Up and Running Locally
==============================

.. index:: pipenv, virtualenv, PostgreSQL


Setting Up Development Environment
----------------------------------

Make sure to have the following on your host:

* Python 3.9
* PostgreSQL_.
* Redis_, if using Celery
* Cookiecutter_

First things first.


#. Install tn-cookiecutter: ::

    $ cookiecutter gh:moussa-m/cookiecutter


   .. note::

       the `pre-commit` hook exists in the generated project as default.
       For the details of `pre-commit`, follow the `pre-commit`_ site.

#. Complete the required vars in .env file: ::

    $ .env

#. CD to {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}: ::

    $  cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}

#. Install pipenv: ::

    $  pip install pipenv

#. install and Start the virtualenv: ::

    $ pipenv install
    $ pipenv shell

#. Create a new PostgreSQL database using createdb_ or run the file install-ubuntu.sh in case you are on ubuntu: ::

    $ createdb {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}_db -U {{cookiecutter.project_slug}} --password !!!SET POSTGRES_PASSWORD!!! 
    or 
    $ chmod +x install-ubuntu.sh
    $ ./install-ubuntu.sh
    
   .. note::

       if this is the first time a database is created on your machine you might need an
       `initial PostgreSQL set up`_ to allow local connections & set a password for
       the ``postgres`` user. The `postgres documentation`_ explains the syntax of the config file
       that you need to change.


#. Apply migrations: ::

    $ python manage.py migrate

#. If you're running synchronously, see the application being served through Django development server: ::

    $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

or if you're running asynchronously: ::

    $ uvicorn config.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --reload

Setup Email Backend
-------------------

MailHog
~~~~~~~

.. note:: In order for the project to support MailHog_ it must have been bootstrapped with ``use_mailhog`` set to ``y``.

MailHog is used to receive emails during development, it is written in Go and has no external dependencies.

For instance, one of the packages we depend upon, ``django-allauth`` sends verification emails to new users signing up as well as to the existing ones who have not yet verified themselves.

#. `Download the latest MailHog release`_ for your OS.

#. Rename the build to ``MailHog``.

#. Copy the file to the project root.

#. Make it executable: ::

    $ chmod +x MailHog

#. Spin up another terminal window and start it there: ::

    ./MailHog

#. Check out `<http://127.0.0.1:8025/>`_ to see how it goes.

Now you have your own mail server running locally, ready to receive whatever you send it.

.. _`Download the latest MailHog release`: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Console
~~~~~~~

.. note:: If you have generated your project with ``use_mailhog`` set to ``n`` this will be a default setup.

Alternatively, deliver emails over console via ``EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'``.

In production, we have Mailgun_ configured to have your back!

.. _Mailgun: https://www.mailgun.com/


Celery
------

If the project is configured to use Celery as a task scheduler then by default tasks are set to run on the main thread
when developing locally. If you have the appropriate setup on your local machine then set the following
in ``config/settings/local.py``::

    CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False
    
To run Celery locally, make sure redis-server is installed (instructions are available at https://redis.io/topics/quickstart), run the server in one terminal with `redis-server`, and then start celery in another terminal with the following command::
    
    celery -A config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info


Client apps
---------------------------------

If youâ€™d like to see how to run the client apps locally, see :ref:`client-apps`.

.. _client_apps:

Compilation 
=================================

- Make sure that nodejs_ is installed. Then in the project root run::

    $ cd client
    $ npm install

.. _nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download/

- Now you just need::

    $ npm run build

The client app will now be created you just need to run ``manage.py runserver localhost:8080`` and open the browser

- In case you just need to run the client app::
    $ npm run dev

Summary
-------

Congratulations, you have made it! Keep on reading to unleash full potential of Thinknimble Cookiecutter.
